                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>Ruby was created by <strong>Yukihiro Matsumoto</strong> (often referred to as "<strong>Matz</strong>") in Japan in the mid-1990s.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            "I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language."
                            <cite>— Yukihiro Matsumoto</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        
                        <p>The first public release of Ruby was in 1995, with Ruby 1.0 officially released in December 1996.</p>
                        
                        <p>Matz combined elements from his favorite programming languages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Perl's text processing and flexibility</li>
                            <li>Smalltalk's pure object-oriented nature</li>
                            <li>Lisp's meta-programming capabilities</li>
                            <li>Python's ease of use</li>
                        </ul>

                <div class="slide-content">
                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>Ruby was designed with a strong focus on <strong>human-oriented</strong> programming. Matz prioritized developer happiness and productivity over machine optimization.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Principle of Least Surprise</h3>
                        <p>Also known as the <em>Principle of Least Astonishment</em>, this philosophy suggests that the language should behave in a way that minimizes confusion for experienced users.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Developer Happiness</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language."

                        <ul>
                            <li>Everything is an object</li>
                            <li>Flexibility over rigidity</li>
                            <li>Elegant syntax that's natural to read and easy to write</li>
                            <li>Balance between functional and imperative programming</li>

                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>Ruby has evolved significantly since its creation, with several major versions and milestones:</p>
                        
                        <h3>Ruby 1.8 (2003)</h3>
                        <p>The version that gained widespread adoption, particularly with the rise of Rails.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Ruby on Rails (2004)</h3>
                        <p>Created by David Heinemeier Hansson, Rails dramatically increased Ruby's popularity worldwide and revolutionized web development with its "convention over configuration" approach.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Ruby 1.9 (2007-2008)</h3>
                        <p>Major performance improvements and new language features, including a new VM called YARV (Yet Another Ruby VM).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Ruby 2.0 (2013)</h3>
                        <p>Introduced keyword arguments, improved garbage collection, and better encoding support.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Ruby 3.0 (2020)</h3>
                        <p>Focused on performance ("Ruby 3x3" goal - 3 times faster than Ruby 2.0), static analysis with RBS, and concurrency improvements with Ractor.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Influence on Other Languages</h3>
                        <p>Ruby has influenced many modern programming languages and frameworks:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Elixir's syntax was heavily inspired by Ruby</li>
                            <li>CoffeeScript borrowed many syntactic elements from Ruby</li>
                            <li>Crystal was designed to have Ruby-like syntax with static typing</li>
                            <li>Frameworks in other languages often follow Rails' conventions</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Developer Experience Innovation</h3>
                        <p>Ruby pioneered many concepts that prioritized developer experience and productivity:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Convention over Configuration</li>
                            <li>Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)</li>
                            <li>Elegant DSLs (Domain Specific Languages)</li>
                            <li>Human-readable code as a primary goal</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Ruby Today</h3>
                        <p>While no longer the trendiest language, Ruby continues to evolve and maintain a dedicated community. It remains a powerful, expressive language for web development, automation, data processing, and more.</p>
